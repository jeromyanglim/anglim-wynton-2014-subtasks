# Analysis of WAB Subtasks

## Overview
Current code and data is available from

https://github.com/jeromyanglim/anglim-wynton-2014-subtasks

Final code upon publication will be archived on Figshare.

## Installation Requirements
The code requires that the following is installed

* R
* JAGS

It also assumes that several R packages are installed:

* foreign, lattice, rjags, coda, lattice, xlsx , Hmisc, ProjectTemplate


## Running the code
The code is organised around ProjectTemplate and RMarkdown. 
The simplest way to run the code is to open one of the `rmd` files in the `reports` directory and run each code chunk one at a time starting from the top.
This can readily be done in RStudio.
